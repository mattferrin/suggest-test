# Privately Reporting Security Concerns

## Lookup My Email Address

> `npm owner ls @clowd/suggest-test`

## Email Me

> Perhaps copying the file contents, adding code comments, and pasting it into the email body could help? Any way that best communicates the concern is fine.

## Private Vulnerability Reporting

> I've also enabled "Private vulnerability reporting", so you should be able to message me via Guthub too.

## Or Do Both

> If you want to half the probability I don't notice, feel free to use both email and Github. Please express any preference for which I use to reply.
